If you decide to follow through with your decision to pull our troops out of Syria, any remnants of ISIS in Syria will surely renew and embolden their efforts in the region, they wrote. In a rare public statement, Mazloum also appealed to Trump, asking him to keep at least half of the two thousand troops in place until all of the Islamic States territory was liberated. A senior U.S. official who had worked closely with Mazloum reflected, Never once did he not live up to exactly what he said he was going to do. The S.D.F. fought on as the United States quietly began pulling out troops and equipment. The U.S.-led international coalition provided air cover, but it depended on the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., to protect their troops on the ground.","The Islamic State has finally fizzled. Mazloum opted for an alliance with the Americans. After a gruelling five-month battle, ISIS experienced its first defeat. Thousands of U.S. and coalition air strikes demolished ISIS offices, barracks, convoys, checkpoints, and arms depots. The Obama Administration also quietly deployed hundreds of additional U.S. Special Forces to Syria. During the 2016 Presidential campaign, Donald Trump had repeatedly blasted the Obama Administration for not doing enough to defeat ISIS. The S.D.F. seized the ISIS capital in October. More than six hundred and fifty S.D.F. fighters Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen, and Syriac Christians were killed in Raqqa. Former U.S. officials familiar with the call told me that the President did not fully grasp the details, players, or regional politics of his own decision to arm the Kurds or that it was the decision that enabled the Kurdish-led S.D.F. The U.S.-backed border force was designed to deal with a problem that Erdogan had not addressed. The Turkish-backed invasion forced Mazloum to pull S.D.F. The final hurdle was to clear Deir Ezzor province, which is home to Syria’s most valuable oil fields. Two days later, Trump tweeted, We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency. The problem was that ISIS had not yet collapsed. fought on as the United States quietly began pulling out troops and equipment. The campaign in Syria liberated roughly the same amount of territory. Together, they seized twenty thousand square miles in northern Syria, a dusty region of crops, pastures, and oil fields that reminded me of Oklahoma. Mazloum had a standing militia that proved it could fight, even with only vintage weapons. His original militia was the People’s Protection Units, or Y.P.G. ; it was Kurdish. The P.K.K. But the Y.P.G. is not a terrorist organization.","Pentagon officials took note. The Islamic State has finally fizzled. “Frankly, our job has just started,” Mazloum warned. ranks,” Mazloum told me. More than a dozen American diplomats and military officials involved in Syria told me the same thing. The Syrian fighters knew only the first names of the Americans, including the commander. The campaign in Syria liberated roughly the same amount of territory. “There are thousands,” General Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the reclusive politician turned commander who led the campaign against ISIS in Syria, told me, when I travelled through the former caliphate last month. American troops wore no identifying insignias, ranks, or names on their uniforms. It ended, in the Syrian farming hamlet of Baghouz, as little more than a junk yard about the size of Central Park, filled with burnt-out vehicles and dilapidated tents. After two months, Mazloum’s militia retreated. But it relied on an unlikely partnership between élite U.S. Special Forces teams and a scrappy local militia led by Mazloum, a middle-aged Kurdish rebel whose face has been weathered by years of conflict and five stints in Syrian prisons. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State’s “caliph” and the world’s most wanted man, has evaded capture.","Summary 1"

More than six hundred and fifty S.D.F. fighters Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen, and Syriac Christians were killed in Raqqa. Former U.S. officials familiar with the call told me that the President did not fully grasp the details, players, or regional politics of his own decision to arm the Kurds or that it was the decision that enabled the Kurdish-led S.D.F. The U.S.-backed border force was designed to deal with a problem that Erdogan had not addressed. The Turkish-backed invasion forced Mazloum to pull S.D.F. The final hurdle was to clear Deir Ezzor province, which is home to Syria’s most valuable oil fields. Two days later, Trump tweeted, We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency. The problem was that ISIS had not yet collapsed. fought on as the United States quietly began pulling out troops and equipment. The campaign in Syria liberated roughly the same amount of territory. Together, they seized twenty thousand square miles in northern Syria, a dusty region of crops, pastures, and oil fields that reminded me of Oklahoma. Mazloum had a standing militia that proved it could fight, even with only vintage weapons. His original militia was the People’s Protection Units, or Y.P.G. ; it was Kurdish. The P.K.K. But the Y.P.G. is not a terrorist organization.","Pentagon officials took note. The Islamic State has finally fizzled. “Frankly, our job has just started,” Mazloum warned. ranks,” Mazloum told me. More than a dozen American diplomats and military officials involved in Syria told me the same thing. The Syrian fighters knew only the first names of the Americans, including the commander. The campaign in Syria liberated roughly the same amount of territory. “There are thousands,” General Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the reclusive politician turned commander who led the campaign against ISIS in Syria, told me, when I travelled through the former caliphate last month. American troops wore no identifying insignias, ranks, or names on their uniforms. It ended, in the Syrian farming hamlet of Baghouz, as little more than a junk yard about the size of Central Park, filled with burnt-out vehicles and dilapidated tents. After two months, Mazloum’s militia retreated. But it relied on an unlikely partnership between élite U.S. Special Forces teams and a scrappy local militia led by Mazloum, a middle-aged Kurdish rebel whose face has been weathered by years of conflict and five stints in Syrian prisons. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State’s “caliph” and the world’s most wanted man, has evaded capture.","Summary 1"
