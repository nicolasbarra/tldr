989,,"(6, 4004)"

993,"While we began with a similar method, in speaking with Professor Callison-Burch, we realized that the idea of trying to train a machine learning algorithm to generate summaries would require a significant amount of time and effort that might be unreasonable to complete in the time remaining in the semester.","(6, 4103)"
994,"Thus, we decided not to pursue that aspect of the project, but we retained the component where we used workers to compare the summaries.","(6, 4104)"
995,,"(6, 4105)"
996,"The primary limitation of our product is that, if we were to implement it as a website where users are able to input the URL of an article that they wish to have summarized and then the website returns to them a Turker-generated summary of that article, there would likely be a considerable time delay between the time that the user inputs the URL and the time the workers are able to complete all of the HITs required to summarize the article in order for the article summary to be returned to the user.","(6, 4200)"
997,This would be especially true as the length of the article that the user decides to input increases.,"(6, 4201)"
998,"Thus, in order for this mechanism be an effective strategy, it would either have to require that there always be a large number of workers present and ready who can complete the tasks very rapidly at any time or necessitate that users input a URL and their email address in order for the completed summary to be sent to them by email once all the requisite HITs have been finished by the Turkers.","(6, 4202)"
