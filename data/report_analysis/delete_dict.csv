463,"At the bottom of the page, there were checkboxes where the worker had to click if they wanted to mark a sentence as important or unimportant, depending on the HIT.","(6, 1501)"

1198,Our project was successful in constructing summaries of articles that were selected to be more informative than the automatically-generated summaries from an online summarizer.,"(6, 3800)"
1199,We evaluated the efficacy of our summary by having workers on Mechanical Turk comparing the summariwa that were created by aggregating the results of the HITs to a summary that was generated through an online summarizer tool.,"(6, 3801)"
1200,"To do this comparison, we created a HIT on MTurk where workers were presented with the the three summaries and asked to select the summary that they preferred.","(6, 3802)"
1201,"Specifically, the workers were asked to “Select the summary that is more coherent and relevant to the title.”","(6, 3803)"

1203,"By far, the biggest challenges that we had to deal with were the technical challenges that we will touch on later.","(6, 3900)"
1204,One of these challenges that we were not over to overcome was an issue with the way we parsed sentences.,"(6, 3901)"
1205,"As we will describe in more detail later on, we used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) Library in Python to parse the articles into sentences.","(6, 3902)"
1206,"While this method worked fairly well, it did not work perfectly in that it resulted in some sentences being truncated too early or too late.","(6, 3903)"
1207,"Thus, when users were selecting sentences they occasionally only selected one part of the sentence and so the summary that was constructed occasionally contained sentence chunks that were not completely sensical without the context provided by the rest of the sentence that might not have been included in the summary.","(6, 3904)"
1208,This present a challenge to the mechanism and quality of our some summarization as the automatic summerizers did a better job of not creating this kind of choppiness even if the overall summary they created was voted to be of worse quality.,"(6, 3905)"
1209,"However, this issue only represents a tiny portion of the challenges that we had to deal with in this project.","(6, 3906)"
1210,"The majority of these challenges were technical, and, thus, we discuss them in greater detail later on when we discuss the technical challenges that we faced.","(6, 3907)"

1212,There were a number of different iterations between our original proposal and our final project.,"(6, 4000)"

1214,Our motivation was that terms and conditions documents are incredibly dense and so much so as to obscures any relevant information.,"(6, 4002)"
1215,"While clearly our motivation did not change much, we realized we were more interested in using this idea to synthesize news articles from The New Yorker, as that was a topic that was of more personal interest to us given that we shared an interest in politics and had all each personally experienced the difficulty of trying to quickly get a sense for what a New Yorker article was saying without having to read the article in its lengthy entirety.","(6, 4003)"
1216,,"(6, 4004)"
