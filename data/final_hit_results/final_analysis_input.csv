Why Turkey’s Election Results Test Erdogan’s Grip on Power,"After the preliminary results of Turkeys municipal elections were announced, on Sunday night, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stood on the terrace of his partys Ankara headquarters with a microphone and, in a sombre tone, launched into a campaign song long popular with his supporters. After the preliminary results came in, Erdogan was quick to point out that, despite losing in the countrys three biggest cities, his party won the larger share of the general vote: 44.32 per cent, compared to 30.11 per cent for the C.H.P. Between its founding, in 1984, and 2002, Turkeys public-housing-development agency produced a little more than forty-three thousand units; during the Erdogan era, between 2003 and 2015, it produced more than five hundred and fifty thousand. The results boosted the hopes of secular voters who have watched Erdogan win election after election and grow increasingly autocratic during his sixteen years in power. Since a 2016 coup attempt failed to remove him from office, Erdogan has centralized power; removed his perceived opponents in the bureaucracy, judiciary, military, and police; and jailed tens of thousands of people. On Tuesday, the A.K.P. Erdogan will try to undermine local government, Cagaptay, the Washington-based Turkey expert, predicted.","For the elections, Erdogan had aligned the A.K.P. and its candidates. In August, 2018, the value of the Turkish lira plunged, losing twenty-eight per cent of its value against the dollar. In an attempt to attract younger voters, the A.K.P. Failing to secure Istanbul has financial consequences for Erdogans ruling party, too. patronage, generating large amounts of rent from construction, urban renovation, and zoning projects for businesses aligned with the Party, Cagaptay said. On Tuesday, the A.K.P. formally contested the Istanbul and Ankara results, alleging irregularities. meddling. . . .","After the preliminary results of Turkey’s municipal elections were announced, on Sunday night, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stood on the terrace of his party’s Ankara headquarters with a microphone and, in a sombre tone, launched into a campaign song long popular with his supporters. The Turkish leader had just learned that his Justice and Development Party, or the A.K.P., had narrowly lost the mayoralty of Ankara, the country’s capital, and might lose Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city, in local elections that were seen as a referendum on his leadership. Both cities had been controlled by the A.K.P. For the elections, Erdoğan had aligned the A.K.P. “Ours is a love story, a bit like a black-and-white film,” Erdoğan sang, as members of the crowd in the streets below joined him. or its Islamist forebears since 1994, when Erdoğan was first elected the mayor of Istanbul. Near the end of the campaign, Erdoğan seemed to grow increasingly desperate. Television closeups showed some people in tears. Erdoğan’s party, though, is already beginning to fight the outcome.

The High Stakes Battle Between Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve,"In private, Bloomberg reported, he has been asking his aides if he can fire Powell, a sixty-six-year-old Republican banker who was confirmed at the start of last year. On Friday, Trump again defied the convention that the President stays out of monetary policy, calling on Powell and his colleagues to cut interest rates in order to boost the economy. In addition to jawboning the Fed, Trump has moved to exert more control over its deliberations by announcing his intention to nominate two of his ardent political supporters to its board of directors: Stephen Moore, a conservative commentator who served as an economic adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016, and Herman Cain, a Republican businessman who ran for President, in 2012.","In January, the Fed indicated that it wouldn't raise interest rates again for the foreseeable future. Moore has been active in Republican politics for decades. His history of making simple errors of data, his forecasts, and his policy pronouncements have shown him to be among the least high-powered economists ever. Cain has a very different background. Ironically, Moore and Cain have both expressed views on monetary policy that identified them as inflation hawks the opposite of Trump. There is another Presidential election on the horizon, the Trump-G.O.P. Even if the Republican-controlled Senate did confirm Moore and Cain to the Feds board, they would only have two votes out of twelve on the F.O.M.C. But there is no guarantee Mr Trump would be overturned, given how effectively he has jammed supportive judges into the system. For months now, Trump has been publicly railing against the Fed. Referring to the rate hikes that the Fed introduced last year, which were the source of his animus toward Powell, Trump said, I think they really slowed us down. Trump's senior economic adviser in the White House, Larry Kudlow, has also called for a rate cut. In addition to jawboning the Fed, Trump has moved to exert more control over its deliberations by announcing his intention to nominate two of his ardent political supporters to its board of directors: Stephen Moore, a conservative commentator who served as an economic adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016, and Herman Cain, a Republican businessman who ran for President, in 2012. The consensus among economists is that the U.S. economy, despite a recent slowdown, remains on pace for modest growth this year, and that a cut in interest rates isn't necessary. meeting they take place eight times a year members consider detailed presentations about the state of the economy from the Feds staff.","On Friday, Trump again defied the convention that the President stays out of monetary policy, calling on Powell and his colleagues to cut interest rates in order to boost the economy. Then you get the White House’s current campaign to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve and its head, Jerome Powell. In private, Bloomberg reported, he has been asking his aides if he can fire Powell, a sixty-six-year-old Republican banker who was confirmed at the start of last year. In Donald Trump’s world, there is always another person responsible for his woes, and, as Kirstjen Nielsen, the departing Secretary of Homeland Security, just discovered, that person often ends up getting fired or forced out. For months now, Trump has been publicly railing against the Fed. But what if Trump doesn’t have the power to dismiss the object of his anger, or he fears blowback from Congress and the financial markets? stimulus is running down, and economic growth is slowing. (The policy discussions are transcribed and released after a delay of five years.) Ignoring widespread criticism that neither Moore nor Cain is remotely qualified to sit on the Fed’s board, Kudlow said on Sunday that Trump is standing behind both of them. In January, the Fed indicated that it wouldn’t raise interest rates again for the foreseeable future."
Kirstjen Nielsen’s Inevitable Resignation from the Department of Homeland Security,"Last May, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, threatened to resign after President Trump humiliated her in a Cabinet meeting. In a recent Oval Office meeting, according to the Washington Post, Trump told Miller that he would be in charge of all immigration and border matters. Theres been talk of creating a new government post known as Trumps immigration tsar, with ranging responsibilities to implement Millers agenda; the names reportedly under considerationincluding the former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli and the former secretary of state of Kansas Kris Kobachare notorious for their partisan and ideological bona fides. Miller appears to hold even greater sway over immigration policy than he did a year ago, and the President, whos reportedly championing a new policy to separate families at the border, is as receptive as ever. If Trump wants a negotiator, someone who has a lot of credibility, the official said, he has that in McAleenan. The official then went on to outline a list of policy priorities for addressing the crisis at the border that might achieve some measure of consensus in Washington. and making unreasonable and even impossible requests. At 5 P.M. on Sunday, Nielsen travelled to the White House to discuss border policy with the President; when she emerged, the President announced her departure. is that she hasnt been an honest broker. The greatest irony of Nielsens tenure may be that, in an Administration full of anti-immigration stalwarts, she was not an ideologue but an opportunist.","Last May, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, threatened to resign after President Trump humiliated her in a Cabinet meeting. More than anything else, though, it was the timing of her confirmation, in December, 2017, that made Nielsen particularly vulnerable; it coincided with an uptick in regional migration, which enabled her detractors within the Administration to portray her to the President as ineffectual and insufficiently loyal to his agenda. Publicly, Nielsen supported the President, but privately, one Administration official told CNN, she felt that the situation was untenable and Trump was becoming increasingly unhinged . . . and making unreasonable and even impossible requests. At 5 P.M. on Sunday, Nielsen travelled to the White House to discuss border policy with the President; when she emerged, the President announced her departure. Three days before Nielsens resignation, the White House had rejected another immigration official for a top job in the Administration. It must be a wonderful world to live in where you are willfully and blissfully ignorant to the realities of law enforcement and still have your seat in the Oval Office. Vitiellos predecessor, an enforcement veteran named Tom Homan, who came out of retirement to lead ICE, had embraced the Presidents aggressive rhetoric. Yet, when it came down to legislation and working with members of Congress, he was cut out. Trump punished him anyway. Nielsens successor as acting head of D.H.S. As head of C.B.P., an agency tasked with policing the border, McAleenan has had limited sway over foreign policy.","For all of McAleenan’s credentials, his new title may be a sign of someone else’s promotion. official told me that spring. At the time, the number of Central American migrants arriving at the U.S. border was rising, with fifty thousand people being arrested each month, and the President was blaming her personally. Nielsen managed to stay in her post only because there was no obvious way for Trump to remove her. “How is this still happening?” Influential figures in the White House, led by Stephen Miller, the President’s senior policy adviser, had long been suspicious of Nielsen’s establishment credentials, and Trump, who personally disliked her, had always resented the fact that her mentor, John Kelly, who was then the White House chief of staff, had forced her nomination on him. Last May, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, threatened to resign after President Trump humiliated her in a Cabinet meeting. “The Administration can’t get rid of Nielsen,” a D.H.S. “That’s what makes me nervous,” one Administration official told me. More than anything else, though, it was the timing of her confirmation, in December, 2017, that made Nielsen particularly vulnerable; it coincided with an uptick in regional migration, which enabled her detractors within the Administration to portray her to the President as ineffectual and insufficiently loyal to his agenda. In March, after months of steady increases in the number of immigrants arriving at the southern border, U.S. authorities arrested nearly a hundred thousand people."
How Trump Betrayed the General Who Defeated ISIS,"In Washington, the backlash to Trumps abrupt decision was immediate. If you decide to follow through with your decision to pull our troops out of Syria, any remnants of ISIS in Syria will surely renew and embolden their efforts in the region, they wrote. In a rare public statement, Mazloum also appealed to Trump, asking him to keep at least half of the two thousand troops in place until all of the Islamic States territory was liberated. A senior U.S. official who had worked closely with Mazloum reflected, Never once did he not live up to exactly what he said he was going to do. The S.D.F. fought on as the United States quietly began pulling out troops and equipment. The U.S.-led international coalition provided air cover, but it depended on the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., to protect their troops on the ground.","The Islamic State has finally fizzled. Mazloum opted for an alliance with the Americans. After a gruelling five-month battle, ISIS experienced its first defeat. Thousands of U.S. and coalition air strikes demolished ISIS offices, barracks, convoys, checkpoints, and arms depots. The Obama Administration also quietly deployed hundreds of additional U.S. Special Forces to Syria. During the 2016 Presidential campaign, Donald Trump had repeatedly blasted the Obama Administration for not doing enough to defeat ISIS. The S.D.F. seized the ISIS capital in October. More than six hundred and fifty S.D.F. fighters Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen, and Syriac Christians were killed in Raqqa. Former U.S. officials familiar with the call told me that the President did not fully grasp the details, players, or regional politics of his own decision to arm the Kurds or that it was the decision that enabled the Kurdish-led S.D.F. The U.S.-backed border force was designed to deal with a problem that Erdogan had not addressed. The Turkish-backed invasion forced Mazloum to pull S.D.F. The final hurdle was to clear Deir Ezzor province, which is home to Syria’s most valuable oil fields. Two days later, Trump tweeted, We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency. The problem was that ISIS had not yet collapsed. fought on as the United States quietly began pulling out troops and equipment. The campaign in Syria liberated roughly the same amount of territory. Together, they seized twenty thousand square miles in northern Syria, a dusty region of crops, pastures, and oil fields that reminded me of Oklahoma. Mazloum had a standing militia that proved it could fight, even with only vintage weapons. His original militia was the People’s Protection Units, or Y.P.G. ; it was Kurdish. The P.K.K. But the Y.P.G. is not a terrorist organization.","Pentagon officials took note. The Islamic State has finally fizzled. “Frankly, our job has just started,” Mazloum warned. ranks,” Mazloum told me. More than a dozen American diplomats and military officials involved in Syria told me the same thing. The Syrian fighters knew only the first names of the Americans, including the commander. The campaign in Syria liberated roughly the same amount of territory. “There are thousands,” General Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the reclusive politician turned commander who led the campaign against ISIS in Syria, told me, when I travelled through the former caliphate last month. American troops wore no identifying insignias, ranks, or names on their uniforms. It ended, in the Syrian farming hamlet of Baghouz, as little more than a junk yard about the size of Central Park, filled with burnt-out vehicles and dilapidated tents. After two months, Mazloum’s militia retreated. But it relied on an unlikely partnership between élite U.S. Special Forces teams and a scrappy local militia led by Mazloum, a middle-aged Kurdish rebel whose face has been weathered by years of conflict and five stints in Syrian prisons. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State’s “caliph” and the world’s most wanted man, has evaded capture."
"Netanyahu, Gantz, and Five Scenarios for the Israeli Election","There is much to learn from this campaign, none of it reassuring. A poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute shows that among Israelis aged sixty-five and older, Gantz beats Netanyahu fifty-three per cent to thirty-five; among voters aged eighteen to twenty-four, Netanyahu beats Gantz sixty-five per cent to seventeen. For that, it will have to hold its own without luring (even more) voters away from Zionist allies in its blockthe Labor Party and the left-wing Meretz Partywho will have to perform at least as well if not better than expected. According to Haaretz, Gantz has hinted which of those parties hed court.","Gantz seems to be counting on eating his Zionist cake while depending on those who would not have it. If the rightist parties decide not to join him, he would have to form a minority government with Labor and Meretz, with the Arab members of Knesset provisionally voting with them from the back benches. He seems to have grasped that swing voters have been looking not for sophisticated policy initiatives or democratic scruples but toughness. The President, Reuven Rivlin, concerned about the integrity of civil society and its judicial institutions, is reported to be entertaining this idea. The only way that he could be moved aside is if Rivlin, who has long been alienated from him, consults with all parties, concedes a virtual tie, and turns to a third member of the Knessetsay, a veteran Likud rival such as Saarand asks that member to assemble a coalition. Each must win three and a quarter per cent of the total vote in order to enter the Knesset; a vote for a party that does not clear that threshold is simply wasted. First, there is the populist Kulanu (All Together), which appeals primarily to Mizrahi Jews, of Middle Eastern descent, who do not see returning to an older Israel, run by descendants of European pioneers, as a plus; Kulanus leader, Moshe Kahlon, is currently the finance minister.","But both are running with a bloc of smaller parties, and Netanyahu’s bloc seems more likely than Gantz’s to win a sixty-one-seat Knesset majority. Given the quirks of the Israeli electoral system, though, the polls may prove misleading. The two continue to run neck and neck in the race for a plurality in the Knesset—with about thirty seats each, out of a total of a hundred and twenty. The President typically bestows a mandate to form a government on the leader of the party that wins a plurality—except in cases where a bloc of parties led by someone else wins a clear majority. In a recent Channel 12 poll, fifty-eight per cent of respondents said that Netanyahu will be the next Prime Minister. If the final polls on the Israeli election are to be believed—by law, there will be no more revealed before the voting begins, on Tuesday morning—things are looking better for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party than for Blue and White, the new centrist party led by the former military Chief of Staff Benny Gantz. Netanyahu is facing indictments. Netanyahu’s proceedings are in the way, however. Consider the head-spinning possibilities: Gantz wins outright—and his problems begin. A majority of voters are now either hoping that he will remain in office, or are bracing for it."
