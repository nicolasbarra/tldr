As S.D.F. capabilities expanded, the U.S. asked Mazloum to take on the biggest challenge yet: liberating Raqqa, the ISIS capital, a city with a quarter of a million residents. Implicit in the U.S. request was an awareness that the fighting was likely to be long, intense, and costly in human life. A senior U.S. official who worked with Mazloum remembered the conversation. “Whatever we laid out to him, what we wanted the campaign to be, he looked at me and said, ‘I trust your judgment. We would probably, for other reasons, do this a little bit differently. I understand your logic, and I agree.’ ” Mazloum noted, however, that he would need more sophisticated arms for urban warfare. This time, he said, the Kurdish Y.P.G. fighters in the S.D.F. would have to receive U.S. arms, as well.

During the 2016 Presidential campaign, Donald Trump had repeatedly blasted the Obama Administration for not doing enough to defeat ISIS. He vowed to do more—much more. “I would bomb the shit out of them,” he said at one rally. “I’d just bomb those suckers. I’d blow up the pipes, I’d blow up the refineries, I’d blow up every single inch—there would be nothing left.” In May, 2017, four months after taking office, Trump approved arms shipments—machine guns, mortars, anti-tank weapons, armored cars, and engineering equipment—to the Kurds. The battle for Raqqa accelerated in June. The S.D.F. seized the ISIS capital in October. More than six hundred and fifty S.D.F. fighters—Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen, and Syriac Christians—were killed in Raqqa.
