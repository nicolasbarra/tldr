Mazloum did not waver, however. “Immediately, we started thinking of the phase after the American presence in Syria, and how we’re going to distribute our forces and depend on our own capacity to preserve those gains,” he told me. “At the end of the day, this is an internal American decision, and we cannot intervene in it. So we started thinking about how we’re going to be able to fight and do policy without them.”

A senior U.S. official who had worked closely with Mazloum reflected, “Never once did he not live up to exactly what he said he was going to do.” The S.D.F. fought on as the United States quietly began pulling out troops and equipment. The final front line was Baghouz, the farming hamlet near the Iraqi border. It was a long slog, with repeated pauses to allow civilians, including the families of ISIS fighters, to leave. “We don’t want the images from our last battle to be bloody,” Mazloum told me. “We’re not ISIS.”

When Baghouz finally fell, on March 23rd, Mazloum hosted a small liberation ceremony at his base. “It was a great day that we celebrated with all our friends and allies,” he messaged me on WhatsApp. “We are proud about what we did, that victory is not just for Kurds. It is for all humanity.” Mazloum invited his American counterparts to attend. In front of the stars and stripes, a band of young Syrians dressed in red-and-gold uniforms played the American national anthem.
