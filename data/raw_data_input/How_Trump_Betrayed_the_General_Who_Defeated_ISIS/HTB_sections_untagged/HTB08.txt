The Turkish-backed invasion forced Mazloum to pull S.D.F. troops away from the front line with ISIS, to defend Afrin—this time without U.S. air power to support them. Washington disapproved of Ankara’s offensive, but Turkey was a NATO ally. The S.D.F. was no match for Turkey’s tanks, artillery, and warplanes. After two months, Mazloum’s militia retreated. Relations soured with the United States; the offensive against ISIS stalled. U.S. intelligence predicted that Mazloum might even end the partnership. “We’re on the two-yard line,” a senior U.S. Special Forces commander told NBC News. “We could literally fall into the end zone. We’re that close to total victory, to wiping out the ISIS caliphate in Syria. We’re that close, and now it’s coming apart.”

The S.D.F. was also scrambling to administer and secure the region—roughly a third of Syria—that it had liberated. Towns were war-ravaged. Basic services were destroyed. Many residents had fled. In Arab areas, the S.D.F. turned to tribal sheikhs to help form new city councils. “The S.D.F. did not just clear territory. They held it,” McGurk, the former lead coördinator of the campaign, told me. “They recruited locals to govern and established a permissive security environment. That’s what allowed us to be in Syria with a very light U.S. footprint.”
