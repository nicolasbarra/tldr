Mazloum’s militia, which included a large female force, returned to the ISIS battlefront last fall. The final hurdle was to clear Deir Ezzor province, which is home to Syria’s most valuable oil fields. In December, the S.D.F. captured Hajin and began mapping out the next two months of operations with U.S. Special Forces. Their focus was on eliminating the stubborn Islamic State pockets near the Iraqi border and stabilizing liberated areas to prevent an ISIS resurgence. “We have obviously learned a lot of lessons in the past, so we know that once the physical space is defeated we can’t just pick up and leave,” McGurk told reporters on December 11th. “We’re prepared to make sure that we do all we can to ensure this is enduring.” U.S. goals, he added, “will take some time.”

Six days later, Mazloum was summoned by General Joseph Votel, the head of U.S. operations in the Middle East, for a video conference. The timing, at midnight in Syria, was unexpected. So was the message. “I was the first one to hear the words,” Salar Malla, Mazloum’s aide-de-camp and translator, told me. “Before you translate anything, you have to absorb it. I spoke the words, but I didn’t believe them.”
