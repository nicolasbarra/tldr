The American overture to Mazloum had both conditions and limits, senior U.S. officials told me. The U.S.-backed coalition could provide strategic advice but no major arms, because of the Y.P.G.’s history. If the Kurds took territory from ISIS, they had to include other ethnic or religious groups, notably Arabs and Christians, in setting up governance and security. The Kurdish militia had to accept that its region would remain part of Syria—and not try to break away into an independent Kurdish state. And they had to vow not to attack Turkish interests. If any of those terms were violated, the U.S. would walk away. Mazloum opted for an alliance with the Americans. “At the time, ISIS was getting stronger every day,” he told me. “We were at capacity just stemming the tide and protecting our area. The United States intervening in this fight changed the balance of power between us and ISIS.”

The makeshift alliance was tested a few weeks later, when ISIS invaded Kobani, a strategic town built as a whistle stop on the Berlin-Baghdad railway. Kobani is Mazloum’s home town. He incorporated it into the nom de guerre by which he is known. (His real name is Ferhat Abdi Şahin.) ISIS seized sixty per cent of the city, forcing most of its forty thousand residents to flee across the border to Turkey. In October, 2014, I watched from a nearby hill in Turkey as ISIS pounded Kobani with thundering artillery. ISIS’s black-and-white flag billowed on the horizon.
