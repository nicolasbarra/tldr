The American overture to Mazloum had both conditions and limits, senior U.S. officials told me<span style="color:Blue;"><b>①</b></span>. The U.S.-backed coalition could provide strategic advice but no major arms, because of the Y.P.G.’s history<span style="color:Blue;"><b>②</b></span>. If the Kurds took territory from ISIS, they had to include other ethnic or religious groups, notably Arabs and Christians, in setting up governance and security<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③</b></span>. The Kurdish militia had to accept that its region would remain part of Syria—and not try to break away into an independent Kurdish state<span style="color:Blue;"><b>④</b></span>. And they had to vow not to attack Turkish interests<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑤</b></span>. If any of those terms were violated, the U.S. would walk away<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑥</b></span>.

The makeshift alliance was tested a few weeks later, when ISIS invaded Kobani, a strategic town built as a whistle stop on the Berlin-Baghdad railway<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑪</b></span>. Kobani is Mazloum’s home town<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑫</b></span>. He incorporated it into the nom de guerre by which he is known<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑬</b></span>. (His real name is Ferhat Abdi Şahin.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑭</b></span>. ISIS seized sixty per cent of the city, forcing most of its forty thousand residents to flee across the border to Turkey<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑮</b></span>. In October, 2014, I watched from a nearby hill in Turkey as ISIS pounded Kobani with thundering artillery<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑯</b></span>. ISIS’s black-and-white flag billowed on the horizon<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑰</b></span>.
