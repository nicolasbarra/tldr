Together, they seized twenty thousand square miles in northern Syria, a dusty region of crops, pastures, and oil fields that reminded me of Oklahoma.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>①</b></span>. When I drove around Raqqa, the former ISIS capital, little girls with ponytails and pastel backpacks were headed to school—after years of being banned from education or even from leaving home.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>②</b></span>. Women, their faces uncovered, strolled to the street markets rising amid the rubble, much of it created by U.S. air strikes.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③</b></span>. Small groups of men sat curbside, sipping their morning tea and smoking, another practice that was banned under ISIS.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>④</b></span>. At several shops, workers were pounding twisted construction rods—giant metal tumbleweeds pulled from bombed-out buildings—to flatten them, for use in reconstruction.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑤</b></span>. Spring lambs, small and pristine white, nibbled along the roadsides.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑥</b></span>. In Washington and other Western capitals, the territorial defeat of ISIS, which for years was considered the greatest threat to global security, will almost certainly be studied as a model for future counterterrorism operations.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑦</b></span>. “The S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑧</b></span>. is the best unconventional partner force we’ve ever had, anywhere,” Brett McGurk, the former lead coördinator of the campaign against ISIS, who is now a fellow at Stanford, told me.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑨</b></span>. “The S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑩</b></span>. in effect conquered one-third of Syria, once the heart of the ISIS caliphate, with very low costs for the United States.” Mazloum, who is on Turkey’s most-wanted list, evolved into one of the most important U.S. allies in the Middle East.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑪</b></span>. The collaboration—which deepened over three phases—is an epic with twists, tragedies, and, ultimately, betrayal at an enormous cost to America’s allies in Syria.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑫</b></span>. Eleven thousand Kurdish fighters have died since 2014.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑬</b></span>. The Americans have lost eight.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑭</b></span>. The alliance was seeded in August, 2014, a month after ISIS declared its caliphate and a week after a lightning ISIS offensive began in Iraq.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑮</b></span>. Marauding ISIS fighters murdered thousands of Yazidi men and abducted truckloads of women.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑯</b></span>. Tens of thousands of fleeing Yazidis, a mostly Kurdish-speaking minority summarily declared apostates by ISIS, were stranded on the arid peaks of Mount Sinjar without food, water, or a way out.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑰</b></span>. Fearing genocide, President Obama authorized the first major U.S. intervention against the Islamic State—air strikes on ISIS positions in Iraq, and air drops of humanitarian goods to the Yazidis.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑱</b></span>. However much Obama wanted to avoid another Middle East war, the United States had just taken on ISIS.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑲</b></span>. The question was what to do next.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑳</b></span>.
