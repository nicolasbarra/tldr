The Kurdish general was initially hesitant about fighting in Syria’s Arab heartland, U.S. officials told me.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>①</b></span>. Kurds and Arabs have a troubled history.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>②</b></span>. Thousands of Sunnis from conservative local Arab tribes had joined ISIS.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③</b></span>. To liberate those areas, Mazloum told his U.S. counterparts, he needed to recruit Arab tribal sheikhs to support him and form an Arab wing of his militia.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>④</b></span>. A purely Kurdish militia wouldn’t be welcome, he warned.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑤</b></span>. In turn, Mazloum wanted the U.S. to train the Arab fighters and provide them with weapons that he did not have—and that his own fighters could not receive because of the Y.P.G.’s controversial status.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑥</b></span>. The U.S. agreed.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑦</b></span>. The Y.P.G.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑧</b></span>. merged with new Arab, Turkmen, and Assyrian wings into the new Syrian Democratic Forces.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑨</b></span>. In October, 2015, the first U.S. team was deployed in Syria to train and advise them.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑩</b></span>. In a grinding campaign that often involved house-to-house fighting and claimed the lives of thousands of S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑪</b></span>. members, the group slowly seized territory—Tal Abyad, al-Hawl, the Tishreen Dam, al-Shaddadi, and Manbij—that cut off land routes for foreign fighters and supplies coming through Turkey.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑫</b></span>. Thousands of U.S. and coalition air strikes demolished ISIS offices, barracks, convoys, checkpoints, and arms depots.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑬</b></span>. They picked off ISIS leaders, including Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the social-media mastermind of ISIS, and Jihadi John, the executioner with a British accent who beheaded, on video, the Americans journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, three Western aid workers, and two Japanese reporters.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑭</b></span>. The Obama Administration also quietly deployed hundreds of additional U.S. Special Forces to Syria.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑮</b></span>. Mazloum, who had kept a low profile after multiple assassination attempts against him, began hosting top Pentagon brass and congressional delegations, including Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who travelled to liberated corners of Syria.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑯</b></span>.
