Kobani proved to be a turning point for Washington.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>①</b></span>. The Obama Administration expanded its intervention, from Iraq into Syria, with air strikes on ISIS forces in Kobani.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>②</b></span>. Among the targets was Mazloum’s home.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③</b></span>. ISIS had seized it as an operations center.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>④</b></span>. Mazloum approved the U.S. decision to destroy it, a senior U.S. official told me.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑤</b></span>. The marriage of American air power and a tough local militia on the ground—dubbed the “hammer and anvil” strategy—succeeded.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑥</b></span>. After a gruelling five-month battle, ISIS experienced its first defeat.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑦</b></span>. In January, 2015, Mazloum’s militia hoisted its yellow banner atop Kobani’s highest hill; fighters, both male and female, danced by firelight amid the city’s bombed-out ruins.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑧</b></span>. Kobani, where more than thirteen hundred Kurds perished, still ranks as the longest, deadliest, and most vicious battle with the Islamic State.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑨</b></span>. It later became a base used by U.S. Special Forces and a small team of U.S. diplomats.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑩</b></span>. The partnership deepened in the second phase.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑪</b></span>. In April, 2015, the U.S. approached Mazloum about leading the war against ISIS beyond Syria’s Kurdish regions.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑫</b></span>. The Obama Administration was on the verge of abandoning a separate Pentagon program to train fifteen thousand Syrians in Turkey and Jordan.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑬</b></span>. Five hundred million dollars had been allocated for the program; ultimately, fifty million dollars were spent, and it produced only a handful of trained soldiers.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑭</b></span>. “I wasn’t happy with the early efforts,” Secretary of Defense Ash Carter admitted at a news conference in Washington at the time.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑮</b></span>. “So we have devised a number of different approaches.” They relied heavily on Mazloum’s militia.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑯</b></span>.
