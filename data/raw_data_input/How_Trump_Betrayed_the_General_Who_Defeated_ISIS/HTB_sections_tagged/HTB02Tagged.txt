The crisis on Mount Sinjar eased after Kurdish fighters—including Mazloum’s militia—created an escape route for the Yazidis into Syria.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>①</b></span>. Pentagon officials took note.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>②</b></span>. The United States had struggled to identify or create a credible rebel force in Syria.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③</b></span>. Mazloum had a standing militia that proved it could fight, even with only vintage weapons.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>④</b></span>. Between 2011 and 2013, without foreign support, it had pushed Syrian government forces out of northern Kurdish towns during the Arab Spring and fought off an Al Qaeda franchise that moved on Kurdish turf.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑤</b></span>. A senior U.S. military official looked for an introduction.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑥</b></span>. The United States was not the only country interested in the Kurdish general, U.S. officials told me.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑦</b></span>. On the morning of August 18th, Mazloum met Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s Quds Force, the most élite unit in the Revolutionary Guard.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑧</b></span>. The Iranians had rushed in—faster than the Americans did—to help the Iraqis hold off the ISIS juggernaut.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑨</b></span>. Hours after meeting the Iranian commander, Mazloum rendezvoused with the American official in Suleimaniya, a Kurdish city in northern Iraq.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑩</b></span>. Mazloum came with complications, however.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑪</b></span>. His original militia was the People’s Protection Units, or Y.P.G.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑫</b></span>. ; it was Kurdish.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑬</b></span>. Its political arm sought autonomy in Syria.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑭</b></span>. Many of its members, including Mazloum, had trained with a militant Turkish movement—the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K.—which was waging an insurgency to win autonomy in Turkey.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑮</b></span>. The P.K.K.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑯</b></span>. was on the U.S. and Turkish lists of terrorist organizations.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑰</b></span>. Its leader, Abdullah Öcalan, had lived in the Kurdish region of Syria for two decades before he was imprisoned, in 1999, in Turkey.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑱</b></span>. Öcalan was a personal friend of Mazloum’s; they were once photographed swimming together in the Euphrates River.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑲</b></span>. “For a period of time, I served in P.K.K.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑳</b></span>. ranks,” Mazloum told me.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③①</b></span>. “Öcalan was working here, and the people here had loyalty to him.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③②</b></span>. But the Y.P.G.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③③</b></span>. is not a terrorist organization.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③④</b></span>. Always the Turks like to paint everything in Syria like it’s the P.K.K., but this is not true.” Yet Mazloum has relatives who are still with the P.K.K.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③⑤</b></span>. Huge posters of Öcalan adorned every Y.P.G.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③⑥</b></span>. and S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③⑦</b></span>. base I visited.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③⑧</b></span>.
