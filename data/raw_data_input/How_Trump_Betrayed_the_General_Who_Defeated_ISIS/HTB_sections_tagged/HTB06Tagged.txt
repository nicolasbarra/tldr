As S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>①</b></span>. capabilities expanded, the U.S. asked Mazloum to take on the biggest challenge yet: liberating Raqqa, the ISIS capital, a city with a quarter of a million residents.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>②</b></span>. Implicit in the U.S. request was an awareness that the fighting was likely to be long, intense, and costly in human life.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③</b></span>. A senior U.S. official who worked with Mazloum remembered the conversation.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>④</b></span>. “Whatever we laid out to him, what we wanted the campaign to be, he looked at me and said, ‘I trust your judgment.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑤</b></span>. We would probably, for other reasons, do this a little bit differently.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑥</b></span>. I understand your logic, and I agree.’ ” Mazloum noted, however, that he would need more sophisticated arms for urban warfare.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑦</b></span>. This time, he said, the Kurdish Y.P.G.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑧</b></span>. fighters in the S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑨</b></span>. would have to receive U.S. arms, as well.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑩</b></span>. During the 2016 Presidential campaign, Donald Trump had repeatedly blasted the Obama Administration for not doing enough to defeat ISIS.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑪</b></span>. He vowed to do more—much more.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑫</b></span>. “I would bomb the shit out of them,” he said at one rally.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑬</b></span>. “I’d just bomb those suckers.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑭</b></span>. I’d blow up the pipes, I’d blow up the refineries, I’d blow up every single inch—there would be nothing left.” In May, 2017, four months after taking office, Trump approved arms shipments—machine guns, mortars, anti-tank weapons, armored cars, and engineering equipment—to the Kurds.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑮</b></span>. The battle for Raqqa accelerated in June.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑯</b></span>. The S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑰</b></span>. seized the ISIS capital in October.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑱</b></span>. More than six hundred and fifty S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑲</b></span>. fighters—Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen, and Syriac Christians—were killed in Raqqa.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑳</b></span>.
