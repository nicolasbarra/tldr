General Votel informed Mazloum that he had received a letter from the White House two hours earlier, ordering the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria<span style="color:Blue;"><b>①</b></span>. Votel did not know the details, he told Mazloum, but he had wanted the Kurd to hear it from him rather than from the media<span style="color:Blue;"><b>②</b></span>. “It was a surprise,” Mazloum told me, at his forward operating base<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③</b></span>. “We didn’t believe that in the middle of the battle, when we’re fighting against ISIS, when we’re fighting against all the others, that our partners would abandon us<span style="color:Blue;"><b>④</b></span>. To be honest, the painful point for us was that America is a great country<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑤</b></span>. How could a great country behave like that and abandon its allies in the middle of the fight<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑥</b></span>. And, from that time on, how are people going to trust in the Americans or partner with them in any fight in the future?<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑦</b></span>. Trump had made the decision unilaterally, U.S. officials told me<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑧</b></span>. There had been no interagency review, no conferring with military brass, no discussions with the dozens of other countries in the U.S.-led coalition<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑨</b></span>. Many were as surprised as Mazloum was<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑩</b></span>. The pivot had been another telephone conversation with President Erdoğan<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑪</b></span>. The Turkish leader asked why the U.S. needed two thousand troops in Syria if the caliphate was collapsing<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑫</b></span>. Two days later, Trump tweeted, “We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.” The problem was that ISIS had not yet collapsed<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑬</b></span>. It still had tens of thousands of fighters, families, and fans in pockets of the Euphrates River Valley<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑭</b></span>.
