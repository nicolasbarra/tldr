The Turkish-backed invasion forced Mazloum to pull S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>①</b></span>. troops away from the front line with ISIS, to defend Afrin—this time without U.S. air power to support them.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>②</b></span>. Washington disapproved of Ankara’s offensive, but Turkey was a NATO ally.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③</b></span>. The S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>④</b></span>. was no match for Turkey’s tanks, artillery, and warplanes.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑤</b></span>. After two months, Mazloum’s militia retreated.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑥</b></span>. Relations soured with the United States; the offensive against ISIS stalled.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑦</b></span>. U.S. intelligence predicted that Mazloum might even end the partnership.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑧</b></span>. “We’re on the two-yard line,” a senior U.S. Special Forces commander told NBC News.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑨</b></span>. “We could literally fall into the end zone.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑩</b></span>. We’re that close to total victory, to wiping out the ISIS caliphate in Syria.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑪</b></span>. We’re that close, and now it’s coming apart.”<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑫</b></span>. The S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑬</b></span>. was also scrambling to administer and secure the region—roughly a third of Syria—that it had liberated.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑭</b></span>. Towns were war-ravaged.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑮</b></span>. Basic services were destroyed.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑯</b></span>. Many residents had fled.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑰</b></span>. In Arab areas, the S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑱</b></span>. turned to tribal sheikhs to help form new city councils.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑲</b></span>. “The S.D.F.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑳</b></span>. did not just clear territory.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③①</b></span>. They held it,” McGurk, the former lead coördinator of the campaign, told me.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③②</b></span>. “They recruited locals to govern and established a permissive security environment.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③③</b></span>. That’s what allowed us to be in Syria with a very light U.S. footprint.”<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③④</b></span>.
