The Islamic State has finally fizzled<span style="color:Blue;"><b>①</b></span>. Its caliphate, daringly declared from the pulpit of the Great Mosque of al-Nuri, in Iraq, in 2014, had been the size of Britain, ruled eight million people, lured recruits from eighty countries, and threatened to redraw the map of the Middle East<span style="color:Blue;"><b>②</b></span>. It ended, in the Syrian farming hamlet of Baghouz, as little more than a junk yard about the size of Central Park, filled with burnt-out vehicles and dilapidated tents<span style="color:Blue;"><b>③</b></span>. Tens of thousands of ISIS loyalists, both fighters and their families, opted to surrender—and face life in crammed prisons and dreary detention camps—rather than become martyrs in ISIS’s promised paradise<span style="color:Blue;"><b>④</b></span>. The dangers are far from over<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑤</b></span>. ISIS has sleeper agents<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑥</b></span>. “There are thousands,” General Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the reclusive politician turned commander who led the campaign against ISIS in Syria, told me, when I travelled through the former caliphate last month<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑦</b></span>. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State’s “caliph” and the world’s most wanted man, has evaded capture<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑧</b></span>. ISIS also still has affiliates active from Nigeria to Afghanistan, from Egypt to the Philippines<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑨</b></span>. “Frankly, our job has just started,” Mazloum warned<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑩</b></span>. “We are finishing the great battle, then we will fight a different kind of war.<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑪</b></span>. The drive to flush ISIS out of Syrian territory was described as “the most successful unconventional military campaign in history” by the Middle East Institute last month<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑫</b></span>. More than a dozen American diplomats and military officials involved in Syria told me the same thing<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑬</b></span>. The campaign was distinct from the counterpart operation in neighboring Iraq, where the United States coördinated with a friendly government, retrained its conventional Army, provided sophisticated weaponry, established a headquarters for a coalition of seventy-four countries, and had legal status granted by parliament<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑭</b></span>. The campaign in Syria liberated roughly the same amount of territory<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑮</b></span>. But it relied on an unlikely partnership between élite U.S. Special Forces teams and a scrappy local militia led by Mazloum, a middle-aged Kurdish rebel whose face has been weathered by years of conflict and five stints in Syrian prisons<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑯</b></span>. They all operated in defiance of the Syrian government and its Russian, Iranian, and Hezbollah allies deployed nearby<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑰</b></span>. Their mission was shrouded in secrecy<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑱</b></span>. American troops wore no identifying insignias, ranks, or names on their uniforms<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑲</b></span>. The Syrian fighters knew only the first names of the Americans, including the commander<span style="color:Blue;"><b>⑳</b></span>. Yet they established an unusual level of trust<span style="color:Blue;"><b>②①</b></span>. The U.S.-led international coalition provided air cover, but it depended on the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., to protect their troops on the ground<span style="color:Blue;"><b>②②</b></span>.
