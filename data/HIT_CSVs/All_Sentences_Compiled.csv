"After the preliminary results of Turkeys municipal elections were announced, on Sunday night, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stood on the terrace of his partys Ankara headquarters with a microphone and, in a sombre tone, launched into a campaign song long popular with his supporters.#$Ours is a love story, a bit like a black-and-white film, Erdogan sang, as members of the crowd in the streets below joined him.#$Television closeups showed some people in tears.#$The Turkish leader had just learned that his Justice and Development Party, or the A.K.P., had narrowly lost the mayoralty of Ankara, the countrys capital, and might lose Istanbul, Turkeys largest city, in local elections that were seen as a referendum on his leadership.#$Both cities had been controlled by the A.K.P.#$or its Islamist forebears since 1994, when Erdogan was first elected the mayor of Istanbul.#$The strongman President had suffered one of the most serious electoral defeats in a quarter-century as the countrys dominant political figure.#$","For the elections, Erdogan had aligned the A.K.P.#$with the ultra-right-wing National Movement Party, with which it currently holds a parliamentary majority, against an opposition coalition led by the secularist Republican Peoples Party (C.H.P.)#$and its candidates.#$The state-run Anadolu news agency reported that, in Istanbul, the C.H.P.s Ekrem Imamoglu garnered 48.79 per cent of the vote, edging out the A.K.P.s Binali Yldrm, a former Prime Minister, by less than three-tenths of a percentage point.#$In Ankara, the C.H.P.#$won by a larger margin, 50.93 per cent to 47.12 per cent.#$(The C.H.P.#$also further secured its grip on Izmir, Turkeys third-largest city, which it has controlled for fifteen years.)#$As of Monday morning, the A.K.P.#$controlled nine fewer cities than it had before the vote; it now holds the mayoralty in thirty-nine of Turkeys eighty-one municipalities.#$","In the fifty days leading up to the elections, Erdogan had campaigned intensively, holding a hundred and two rallies in fifty-nine citiesand adopted increasingly nationalist rhetoric.#$Invoking a conspiracy that Turkey faces existential threats to its existence and prosperity by foreign-backed enemies, he claimed that the elections concerned the countrys national security more than its municipal governance.#$On International Womens Day, March 8th, when thousands of participants demonstrated in Istanbul for womens rights, he declared them invaders and assured his supporters that the Turkish state can topple them with our police force and military.#$ Following the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15th, he showed fragments of the video taken by the terrorists helmet camera at rallies; he warned of the gunmans call for Christians to recapture Istanbul and vowed that attackers targeting Turkey would return home in caskets.#$ During the final week of the race, he announced that the military had conducted an air strike on a camp, in the Qandil mountains of northern Iraq, believed to belong to the Kurdistan Workers Party, or the P.K.K., a militant Kurdish separatist group that has been fighting the Turkish government for thirty-five years.#$",1,1
"Erdogans sharp rhetoric appeared to be an effort to distract voters from Turkeys spiralling economic crisis, one that opposition members say is fuelled and perpetuated by Erdogans politics.#$In August, 2018, the value of the Turkish lira plunged, losing twenty-eight per cent of its value against the dollar.#$Though the lira has rebounded slightly since then, the country officially entered its first recession in a decade in March.#$Inflation is at twenty per cent, the price of produce has skyrocketed, and the federal minimum wage has fallen by roughly ten per cent since this time last year, to three hundred and sixty dollars a month.#$To force down prices, Erdogan installed government-subsidized vegetable stalls in city squares around the country.#$He also called for Turkeys banking regulator to investigate a JPMorgan plot that he claimed was causing volatility in the value of the lira.#$","Near the end of the campaign, Erdogan seemed to grow increasingly desperate.#$Five days before the polls, he pledged to turn the Hagia Sophiaa Greek Orthodox cathedral turned Ottoman mosque turned museum, built by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, in 537back into a mosque, a politically radical move that took even his supporters by surprise.#$In an attempt to attract younger voters, the A.K.P.#$built a Web site, GeleceginiSec.com (ChooseYourFuture.com), inspired by Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, the latest interactive episode of the Netflix series.#$It allowed viewers to control the decisions of a young Turkish software coder on Election Day.#$His choice is to vote for the A.K.P.#$or for the Otherswhich, according to the video, would spark mayhem in Turkeys streets and an economic collapse.#$","After the preliminary results came in, Erdogan was quick to point out that, despite losing in the countrys three biggest cities, his party won the larger share of the general vote: 44.32 per cent, compared to 30.11 per cent for the C.H.P.#$As President, he still has the mandate to govern Turkey for another four years, until the next scheduled federal elections.#$Yet, on the campaign trail, he had often repeated the mantra Whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey. Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the author of The New Sultan: Erdogan and the Crisis of Modern Turkey, told me that the loss of the countrys largest city was potent.#$Istanbul is where Erdogans political career started, and it made him a rock star, in political terms, he said.#$Losing that city is a big blow to his political brand.#$",1,2
"Failing to secure Istanbul has financial consequences for Erdogans ruling party, too.#$In recent years, the city has served as a major source of A.K.P.#$patronage, generating large amounts of rent from construction, urban renovation, and zoning projects for businesses aligned with the Party, Cagaptay said.#$Under A.K.P.#$rule, government-owned housing has grown significantly.#$Between its founding, in 1984, and 2002, Turkeys public-housing-development agency produced a little more than forty-three thousand units; during the Erdogan era, between 2003 and 2015, it produced more than five hundred and fifty thousand.#$The ruling partys defeat in Istanbul means losing a significant source of rent to the opposition, Cagaptay saida major revenue source that has oiled the gears of the A.K.P.#$machine and Erdogans rise.#$","The results boosted the hopes of secular voters who have watched Erdogan win election after election and grow increasingly autocratic during his sixteen years in power.#$Since a 2016 coup attempt failed to remove him from office, Erdogan has centralized power; removed his perceived opponents in the bureaucracy, judiciary, military, and police; and jailed tens of thousands of people.#$Nazm Dikbas, an artist living in Istanbuls Beyoglu district, told me that he hoped the results would create a more democratic atmosphere.#$I am cautious about getting carried away, but I am hopeful, he said.#$","Erdogans party, though, is already beginning to fight the outcome.#$On Tuesday, the A.K.P.#$formally contested the Istanbul and Ankara results, alleging irregularities.#$But, even if the current results are corroborated by the final vote counts, which are expected on April 11th, at the earliest, some fear unrest during the transfer of power.#$Others are anxious about A.K.P.#$meddling.#$Erdogan will try to undermine local government, Cagaptay, the Washington-based Turkey expert, predicted.#$There will be a contentious relationship.#$.#$.#$.#$[He] may not be so willing to settle for a Turkish-style cohabitation between his rule and opposition-controlled cities.#$",1,3
"In Donald Trumps world, there is always another person responsible for his woes, and, as Kirstjen Nielsen, the departing Secretary of Homeland Security, just discovered, that person often ends up getting fired or forced out.#$But what if Trump doesnt have the power to dismiss the object of his anger, or he fears blowback from Congress and the financial markets?#$Then you get the White Houses current campaign to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve and its head, Jerome Powell.#$","For months now, Trump has been publicly railing against the Fed.#$In private, Bloomberg reported, he has been asking his aides if he can fire Powell, a sixty-six-year-old Republican banker who was confirmed at the start of last year.#$(According to legal experts, the question is a murky one.)#$On Friday, Trump again defied the convention that the President stays out of monetary policy, calling on Powell and his colleagues to cut interest rates in order to boost the economy.#$Referring to the rate hikes that the Fed introduced last year, which were the source of his animus toward Powell, Trump said, I think they really slowed us down. Trumps senior economic adviser in the White House, Larry Kudlow, has also called for a rate cut.#$","In addition to jawboning the Fed, Trump has moved to exert more control over its deliberations by announcing his intention to nominate two of his ardent political supporters to its board of directors: Stephen Moore, a conservative commentator who served as an economic adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016, and Herman Cain, a Republican businessman who ran for President, in 2012.#$Ignoring widespread criticism that neither Moore nor Cain is remotely qualified to sit on the Feds board, Kudlow said on Sunday that Trump is standing behind both of them.#$We have two open seats, he told CNN.#$The President has every right in the world to nominate people who share his economic philosophy.#$",2,1
"How serious is the threat to the Feds independence?#$Richard Nixon and George H. W. Bush both groused about the Feds interest-rate policies, which they saw as overly constrictive, but neither of them engaged in a sustained public attack on the central bank, as Trump has done.#$As with other Presidents, their nominees to the Feds board tended to be economists and bankers with expertise in monetary policy or financial regulation, which are the banks two main areas of responsibility.#$Moore and Cain dont fit either pattern.#$","On Friday, the editorial page of the Financial Times said that the nominations of Moore and Cain surely qualify as sabotage. Many people who follow the Feds deliberations agree.#$It is as serious of a threat to the Fed as I have seen in my lifetime, Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, told me.#$It raises the prospect of a dysfunctional Fed, and a dysfunctional Fed would lead to a dysfunctional economy.#$","The consensus among economists is that the U.S. economy, despite a recent slowdown, remains on pace for modest growth this year, and that a cut in interest rates isnt necessary.#$On Friday, the Labor Department reported that employers created a hundred and ninety-six thousand jobs last month.#$For the first quarter of 2019, the monthly average was a healthy hundred and eighty thousand.#$The March report should put to rest the notion that the economy is doomed to falter in 2019, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, wrote in a blog post.#$",2,2
"To be sure, there are economists who dissent from this analysis and agree with the White House that the Fed has been too hawkish.#$David Blanchflower, an economist at Dartmouth who has served on the Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee, said that the Feds decision to raise the federal-funds rate by another quarter point in December was completely unnecessary and, especially given the slowdown in the global economy, raised the risk of a recession.#$Despite the fact that Kudlow, Moore, and the POTUS know nothing about economics, Blanchflower said, they are right on this one.#$","That is a minority view, but there is almost always some variation of opinion among economists about the appropriate level of interest rates.#$The advantage of having an independent central bank is that technical economic debates are, at least partly, divorced from the political arena.#$The Federal Open Market Committee has twelve voting members: seven Fed governors appointed by the President and five presidents of regional reserve banks.#$Fed governors are appointed for fixed terms; they can only be fired for cause, and, in the Feds century of existence, this has never happened.#$At each F.O.M.C.#$meetingthey take place eight times a yearmembers consider detailed presentations about the state of the economy from the Feds staff.#$Then they engage in lengthy discussions, some of which are pretty arcane, before voting on what to do.#$(The policy discussions are transcribed and released after a delay of five years.)#$","You definitely feel like you are working in an independent institution, Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who worked as an economist at the Fed for almost twenty-five years, said.#$The fixed terms and the fact that they have never been violated really insulates these people. In attending numerous F.O.M.C.#$meetings as a resident expert, Gagnon said that the discussions he witnessed were entirely about economics, and politics never came up.#$Now, you could say it is in the back of their minds, but I think even that is a bit of a stretch for any of the members I have seen, he said.#$I think they did what they thought was best for the country.#$They are not worried about their jobs, and they think that is what they have been put there to do.#$",2,3
"Powell, who worked at the Treasury Department in the George H. W. Bush Administration and joined the board of the Fed in 2012, seems determined to protect the Feds independence.#$In January, the Fed indicated that it wouldnt raise interest rates again for the foreseeable future.#$In explaining this about-turn, Powell had pointed to a slowing economy and quiescent inflation.#$A week later, he and the Feds vice-chairman, Richard Clarida, an economist at Columbia University, were invited to dine at the White House with Trump and Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary.#$Evidently concerned that the sight of Powell meeting with Trump might create the impression that the Fed had buckled, the bank issued an unusual statement immediately after the dinner, in which it said that Powell told the President that he and his colleagues would set monetary policy in order to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective and non-political analysis.#$How Trump reacted to Powells declaration of independence isnt known.#$But it wasnt very long before he started criticizing the Fed again.#$He also fastened on the idea of filling two vacancies on its board with Moore and Cain.#$","Moore has been active in Republican politics for decades.#$A co-founder of the Club for Growth, a nonprofit that pushes for low taxes and spending cuts, he is now a fellow at the Heritage Foundation.#$But it isnt just Moores conservatism that his critics are focussing on.#$He has shown himself to be incompetent, Wolfers said.#$His history of making simple errors of data, his forecasts, and his policy pronouncements have shown him to be among the least high-powered economists ever. Cain has a very different background.#$From 1986 to 1996, he was the chief executive of Godfathers Pizza.#$He also headed the National Restaurant Association for a time and served on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which is largely made up of prominent local businesspeople and doesnt have any policy role.#$","Ironically, Moore and Cain have both expressed views on monetary policy that identified them as inflation hawksthe opposite of Trump.#$Cain even advocated a return to the gold standard, the draconian monetary system that helped bring about the Great Depression.#$Its safe to assume that these views werent what got Trumps attention.#$Last year, Moore published a book hailing Trumps economic policies; in December, he called on Trump to fire Powell, and last month he penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal titled The Fed Is a Threat to Growth.#$ Cain has been a less visible supporter of Trump, but in September he formed a new Super PAC, America Fighting Back, which says, on its home page, We must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment.#$In announcing his intention to nominate Cain to the Fed, Trump called him a terrific man.#$",2,4
"What is going on is perfectly clear.#$There is another Presidential election on the horizon, the Trump-G.O.P.#$stimulus is running down, and economic growth is slowing.#$With the Democrats controlling the House of Representatives, Trump knows that he cant rely on Congress to juice the economy again going into 2020.#$So he is trying to bully the Fed into doing the job, regardless of the longer-term consequences.#$","Its far from clear that this effort will succeed.#$Even if the Republican-controlled Senate did confirm Moore and Cain to the Feds board, they would only have two votes out of twelve on the F.O.M.C.#$: Powell and his allies could easily outvote them.#$But that might not be the end of it.#$The danger is that Mr Trump is preparing to remove Mr Powell himself, in spite of having appointed him, the Financial Times editorial pointed out.#$Such a move would be challenged in the courts.#$But there is no guarantee Mr Trump would be overturned, given how effectively he has jammed supportive judges into the system.#$That would take the US Fed into uncharted waters.#$","Not just the Fedthe entire U.S. system of government.#$The biggest danger of a Trump Presidency has always been that it would undermine some of the countrys key institutions, such as Congress, the courts, and independent government agencies.#$So far, the system haswith some notable exceptionsstood up reasonably well under the Trumpian assault.#$But the game isnt over yet.#$In an effort to concentrate power in his own hands, Trump will continue to push things as far as he can and to appoint as many lackeys as he can.#$The attack on the Fed is part of a larger pattern.#$That is why the stakes are so high, and why Trump must be stopped.#$",2,5
"If the final polls on the Israeli election are to be believedby law, there will be no more revealed before the voting begins, on Tuesday morningthings are looking better for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus Likud Party than for Blue and White, the new centrist party led by the former military Chief of Staff Benny Gantz.#$The two continue to run neck and neck in the race for a plurality in the Knessetwith about thirty seats each, out of a total of a hundred and twenty.#$But both are running with a bloc of smaller parties, and Netanyahus bloc seems more likely than Gantzs to win a sixty-one-seat Knesset majority.#$","The President typically bestows a mandate to form a government on the leader of the party that wins a pluralityexcept in cases where a bloc of parties led by someone else wins a clear majority.#$That is how Netanyahu won in 2009, and its why the polls still favor him.#$A majority of voters are now either hoping that he will remain in office, or are bracing for it.#$In a recent Channel 12 poll, fifty-eight per cent of respondents said that Netanyahu will be the next Prime Minister.#$But only thirty-six per cent wanted him to be.#$","Given the quirks of the Israeli electoral system, though, the polls may prove misleading.#$The margin of error is around four per cent, which means that it may be impossible to divine the fates of the all-important smaller parties.#$Each must win three and a quarter per cent of the total vote in order to enter the Knesset; a vote for a party that does not clear that threshold is simply wasted.#$Fully seven partiestwo in Gantzs potential bloc, five in Netanyahushave been polling close to extinction at various points in the campaign.#$Moreover, according to an April 2nd poll, more than eight per cent of voters are still undecided.#$",3,1
"So Gantzs bloc could squeak out a win.#$Or Netanyahus could win in a landslide.#$Or either leader could win a plurality for his party, but not a majority for his bloc.#$In fact, the polls reveal little about the serious difficulties that either of them, even with a clear win, will face in forming a government.#$Consider the head-spinning possibilities:#$","Gantz wins outrightand his problems begin.#$For Blue and White to win a plurality, a significant number of secular, formerly right-of-center voters will have to support it.#$So will a significant number of young first-time voters.#$This is a tall order: to most Israelis, the business sector seems strong, as does the deterrence of enemies, and Netanyahu gets credit for both.#$So even young Israelis tend to skew right.#$A poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute shows that among Israelis aged sixty-five and older, Gantz beats Netanyahu fifty-three per cent to thirty-five; among voters aged eighteen to twenty-four, Netanyahu beats Gantz sixty-five per cent to seventeen.#$","Gantz and his allies have been courting these secular, security-minded voters, promising to provide a hard line on securitythree of the four senior leaders of Blue and White are former generalsand that he will form a government only with Zionist (read: non-Arab) parties.#$He is also stressing the importance of the rule of law, warning of Netanyahus alliance with messianists and proto-fascist followers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahaneof the danger that Netanyahu is turning Israel into an authoritarian theocracy, as Recep Tayyip Erdogan has done in Turkeyand promising to force ultra-Orthodox Haredi schools, which focus on religious studies, to also teach such basic subjects as math and English.#$He is presenting himself as a return to an eclipsed, progressive Israeliness.#$",3,2

"Last May, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, threatened to resign after President Trump humiliated her in a Cabinet meeting.#$At the time, the number of Central American migrants arriving at the U.S. border was rising, with fifty thousand people being arrested each month, and the President was blaming her personally.#$Why dont you have solutions? he demanded at the meeting.#$How is this still happening?

The greatest irony of Nielsens tenure may be that, in an Administration full of anti-immigration stalwarts, she was not an ideologue but an opportunist.#$While she was never a true believer, like Stephen Miller, she became nearly as notorious, having weaponized immigration policy in the battle for her own political survival.#$",4,1

John Amaya, the deputy chief of staff at ICE from 2015 to 2017, said.#$Given the politics, laws, regulations, litigation, and operational constraints, what more could the agency accomplish under someone elses leadership?#$It must be a wonderful world to live in where you are willfully and blissfully ignorant to the realities of law enforcement and still have your seat in the Oval Office.#$","Trump has made immigration enforcement the rallying cry of his Presidency.#$But his politicization of D.H.S.and especially of ICE, its interior enforcement armhas repeatedly backfired.#$More than two years into his term, Trump still does not have a confirmed head of the agency.#$Vitiellos predecessor, an enforcement veteran named Tom Homan, who came out of retirement to lead ICE, had embraced the Presidents aggressive rhetoric.#$Trump praised him for looking very nasty and very mean, but his close identification with the President also made him politically toxic, and Homan resigned last year, after a tumultuous tenure in which the Senate never confirmed him.#$It was a matter of time before Tom would leave, a former D.H.S.#$official who knew Homan told me at the time.#$Its a dead-end job.#$Hes been on TV non-stop talking about what they are doing and defending the Administrations policies at every turn.#$Yet, when it came down to legislation and working with members of Congress, he was cut out.#$The official added that Homan was tired of being sent on these missions by the White House to scorch the earth.#$Vitiello, who appeared to learn the lesson of Homans demise, was careful to tell the President what he needed to hear while also keeping a lower public profile.#$Trump punished him anyway.#$",4,2

McAleenan did not think up the Administrations family-separation policy, for example, but he did play a role in implementing it.#$In April of 2018, his name was at the top of a document signed by three agency heads at D.H.S.including Tom Homan, at ICE, and Francis Cissna, at Citizen and Immigration Servicesarguing that family separation would deter other immigrant families, according to someone who saw the document.#$In December, as the Trump Administration tightened restrictions at ports of entry and migrants crossed in increasingly remote areas of the desert, two Guatemalan children died in the custody of Border Patrol.#$McAleenan is a career civil servant, and I believe he wants to see his job through to the end, regardless of the Administration, the official told me.#$In the Trump Era, doing so comes at a high cost.#$",4,3
"For all of McAleenans credentials, his new title may be a sign of someone elses promotion.#$In a single week, Stephen Miller has successfully torpedoed the careers of two D.H.S.#$officials and has shown his ever-expanding influence within the Administration.#$In a recent Oval Office meeting, according to the Washington Post, Trump told Miller that he would be in charge of all immigration and border matters.#$Theres been talk of creating a new government post known as Trumps immigration tsar, with ranging responsibilities to implement Millers agenda; the names reportedly under considerationincluding the former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli and the former secretary of state of Kansas Kris Kobachare notorious for their partisan and ideological bona fides.#$Miller appears to hold even greater sway over immigration policy than he did a year ago, and the President, whos reportedly championing a new policy to separate families at the border, is as receptive as ever.#$On Sunday, I asked the Administration official whether McAleenan stood a chance of leading the Department under these circumstances.#$If Trump wants a negotiator, someone who has a lot of credibility, the official said, he has that in McAleenan.
